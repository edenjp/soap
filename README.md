# Soap Automation using cucumber and rspec.

The purpose of this project is to provide help for those who needs to do a automation of projects using cucumber, capybara, rspec and httparty to call rest API's or Soap API's, whithout install new gem's or uses another applications. I'm also using Scenario Outline on cucumber.


## What is Soap? 

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is the universal standard used for exchanging messages between applications and the Web Service.
The Web Service exposes its operations through an XML schema type called Web Service Description Language (WSDL). 

## Using a free WEB Service CEP Consultation

The CEP Consultation Service is free to use. Currently, it works with the post office postal base and contains more than 926,000 Brazilians sites corresponding to the base of October 2013 (Updated 06/11/2013). Find more of it [here](http://www.byjg.com.br/site/xmlnuke.php?xml=onlinecep).
Acccording to this site you will going to need a user and password to do an authentication, thats not our porpuse here, so you find only how to call a soap API. 

## Give me a feedback

If you know a faster or better way to call Soap API using cucumber, capybara and rspec, please let me know. Or even a new simple way, but totally different.
